    <!-- What does the game consist of?
    playing field
    obstacles - elements styled and positioned within the field with CSS
    starting position - moving the mouse here starts the game
    ending position - moving the mouse here without touching the obstacles ends the game
    In the code of the game you should handle the following:

    game state - in what phase does the game find itself? Not started, started, finished or game over. This information should be probably stored in a variable. Each of the states should be somehow represented on the playfield. The easiest way would be to switch classes of the field everytime the state changes.
    changing the game state when the mouse moves onto the start field, when it moves onto an obstacle and when it moves onto the end field.
    Optional
    Prevent cheating: surround the playfield with 4 more boxes so that it is perfectly wrapped in them. When the mouse moves over them, the game is over.

    Add multiple levels: the layout of the obstacles can change immediatelly for example just by changing a class of the playing field. Specify multiple different layouts with CSS and switch them when needed. -->
